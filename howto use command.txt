## install
Maybe this command is wrong?
$ npm install --save-dev babel-cli 
 
## Command to run API
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node src/index.js

will get  >>> Listening on port 5000.

- run http://localhost:5000/eq on web browser will see data as json
- For discord bot Need to edit API url in bot.js file >>>  request('http://localhost:5000/eq', .... 
  when deploy to server need to change URL
